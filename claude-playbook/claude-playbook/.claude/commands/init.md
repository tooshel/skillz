# init

Stand up the working files for a project so the later phase commands have
something to fill. You **create structure, not content** — stubs with headings
and TODOs, never invented decisions.

## CLAUDE.md Template

Use this when creating CLAUDE.md

```md
# [Fill in]

[Project summary, ask if there isn't one]

## Rules

- DO NOT REPORT SOMETHING IS FIXED IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPILED THE APP
- DO NOT SEARCH node_modules for answers. GO ONLINE.
- Use emoji for markdown documents for readability.
- Get to the point, be terse, do not over explain. Tokens are water, we're in the desert. Use emoji instead of prose if you can.
- Never install a package by editing the manifest, always use a package install tool, such as `npm install`, `bun install`, etc.

```

## Scope

- IN: create CLAUDE.md, the `docs/` skeleton, a README stub, `.gitignore`.
- OUT: deciding what the project *is* or how it's built (that is `/sprint`),
  tasks (`/plan`). This command does not interview the problem.

## Preflight

1. Re-entrant: if a file already exists, **leave it alone**. Report what was
   already there vs. what you created. Never clobber.
2. Detect the ground:
   - Code already present → seed CLAUDE.md from what's actually there
     (language, test command, run command, layout). Be factual, no guessing.
   - Empty dir → CLAUDE.md gets a stub with those headings and `TODO`.

## Produce

- **CLAUDE.md** (root, owned here): the **how**. Stack, conventions, test &
  run commands, the commands available (`/sprint`, `/build-loop`,
  `/quick-fix`, `/document`, plus `/explore` and `/design` for deep
  dives), and the rule that each doc has one owner.
- **docs/ARCHITECTURE.md**: stub. `/sprint` adds each sprint's decisions
  to it. `/design` owns a full rewrite.
- **docs/STORIES.md**: stub, owned by `/plan`.
- **docs/PLAN.md** — stub, owned by `/plan`. Empty checklist.
- **docs/MEMORY.md** — the project decision log: decisions made with AI,
  preserved for Claude Code. Header + an empty dated-entry list. Curated by
  `/document`; appended to by every phase command. Distinct from the
  `~/.claude` memory system.
- **README.md** — one-line stub, owned by `/document`.

Each stub names its owner command at the top so nobody writes the wrong file.

Don't create these. Their owners make them when they run:
`docs/BRIEF.md` (`/sprint`), `docs/PROJECT.md` (`/explore`),
`docs/SPEC.md` (`/design`).

## Interview

Almost none. Ask at most: project name (if not in `$ARGUMENTS`), and — only if
code exists and it's ambiguous — the test and run commands. Otherwise stay
silent and scaffold.

## Hand off

End with the file list (created vs. skipped) and:
`Suggested next: /sprint <what you want built>`
