Turn the design into something the build process can execute. This command
**transforms** its input. It does not re-elicit requirements.

## Scope

- IN: derive user stories, order tasks into a dependency-aware checklist,
  mark what can run concurrently, then generate pending specs from the
  finalized stories.
- OUT: gathering requirements (`/sprint`, or `/explore` and `/design`),
  building (`/build-loop`).

## Preflight

1. **Find the input.** Use the first of these that is filled in:
   - `docs/BRIEF.md` (from `/sprint`). "What they'll be able to do" is the
     behavioral spec. "How we'll build it" is the design.
   - `docs/SPEC.md` plus `docs/PROJECT.md` (from `/design` and `/explore`).

   If neither exists, or what's there is a stub full of `TODO`, **stop**.
   There's nothing to plan. Point the human at `/sprint`.
2. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` and `docs/MEMORY.md`.
3. Read existing `docs/STORIES.md` / `docs/PLAN.md`. Re-entrant: reconcile
   and extend. Never silently drop or renumber completed (`- [x]`) tasks.

## Stories

Delegate to the **`user-stories`** skill to produce or refine
`docs/STORIES.md`. It formats Story→Feature with Given/When/Then so
`bdd-specs` can consume it. Don't hand-roll the format, and tell it to
draft with `> ASSUMPTION:` lines in place of interviewing.

## Extras

Every item the human approved under "What you didn't ask for" in the brief
becomes its own task, tagged `delight:`.

- One extra, one task, one commit.
- It comes **after** the task it decorates.
- **Nothing depends on a `delight:` task.** That's what makes it safe to
  strike later.
- Extras the human struck at the gate do not appear. Don't add new ones
  here. That's the product owner's call, made in the brief.

## Specs (always, no asking)

Once `docs/STORIES.md` and `docs/PLAN.md` are written, delegate to the
**`bdd-specs`** skill to generate spec files from the stories.

**Every generated spec is pending** (`it.todo` / `it.skip` / `test.todo`,
whichever the runner uses). The builder activates the specs for its task
when it starts that task, watches them fail, then makes them pass. That
keeps the suite green between tasks, so a red test always means something
broke.

`/spec` runs this same step on its own, for stories added later.

## Interview

- **Called from `/sprint`:** none. The human already approved the brief.
  Make the slicing calls yourself and log anything non-obvious in
  `docs/MEMORY.md`.
- **Run directly:** light confirmation, 3 to 5 questions, batched:
  1. Here's how I sliced it into stories. Anything mis-cut or missing?
  2. Priority and sequence right? What's the first shippable slice?
  3. Any task I marked parallel that shares state?
  4. Hard external dependencies that gate ordering?

## Produce

- **docs/STORIES.md** (owned, via `user-stories` skill).
- **docs/PLAN.md** (owned): a checklist `build-loop` can execute.
  - every task is `- [ ]`, top-to-bottom in dependency order;
  - each task line carries: a short id, the story it implements
    (`story:`), explicit `depends-on:` ids, and a `parallel-group:` tag for
    tasks with no ordering between them;
  - extras carry `delight:` and the one-line why from the brief;
  - one task = one reviewable, committable unit of work;
  - no task references a file or decision that isn't in the brief,
    ARCHITECTURE.md, or SPEC.md.
- **Wire tasks are first-class.** For every feature that touches a deployed
  entry point (exported handler, route file, `default.fetch`, Next route),
  include an explicit `wire: <feature> into <entry>` task whose acceptance is
  a real request through the production binary producing the spec's side
  effect. A task whose only acceptance criterion is "unit tests pass" is not
  allowed for code on a production path. That's how stubs ship.
- **Pending specs** (via `bdd-specs` skill). Not optional.
- **docs/MEMORY.md**: append dated entries for sequencing decisions that
  weren't obvious (why X blocks Y, why a slice was deferred).

## Hand off

Summarize: N stories, M tasks (D of them `delight:`), S spec files
generated, the first parallel group, then:
`Suggested next: /build-loop docs/PLAN.md (specs are in place and pending).`
